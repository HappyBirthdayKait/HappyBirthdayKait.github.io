				<title>Christmas 2017</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;h class=&quot;center&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;🎄MERRY CHRISTMAS!🌟&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year you got my full christmas experience. Everything I am used to including the 3 day event. Christmas eve at my grandfathers for his birthday, christmas at my moms, and then the day after christmas with my dad. 
My grandpa’s birthday was fun, although hot! After all festivities, we continued out to all the christmas lights in the cold. We had to leave hartland because of the life size nutcrackers, but it was surely a memory to remember. It was a sight to see all around. 😍😉
This was our first christmas together. After some awkward conversation, you and I were arranged to stay together in my old room so that we could wake up in my room on christmas Eve. I think after this one, you understand the madness. I ran upstairs to jump on Brennan while you were drying your hair and jumped on Brennan “ITS CHRISTMAS ITS CHRISTMAS” just like he always got the pleasure of doing to me. It was just as fun as he said it was 😌. We spent all day opening presents and I got 2 pairs of slippers that were again too small just like the rest, a blanket from my mom that has shirts from my whole baseball career on it, and many other things. Your favorite seemed to be the largest, heaviest present under the tree which ended up small enough to be on your finger. You seem to really love it though, and after you open it (cant tell in the video) you whispered in my ear “I think I’m going to cry”. I love to make you happy 😍 Theres no better feeling. Of course the day ends in catch phrase and we went home to unpack and order Chinese.
The next day was a calmer day by comparison, but still just as special. Met my dad at his house, opened presents, talked to Taryn while we ate pulled pork in the living room. My grandmother passed down the windup ice-skaters that I &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; played with at her house. We watched more Lifetime movies while I write this and you play angry birds and I couldn’t be happier. 😇&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>1st Bar Night</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;T’was the friday of dead week, so rather than being good students we came home to just chill out all night. While chilling you said “Lets build a fort” so I built the whole thing and had to drag you away from your dishes to help me, but it turned out reallllly nice! (Thats what you get for dating and engineer) I then tried to surprise you with a pizza but instead you got the email notification and then I realized I told it to go to your email 🙄. Later on that night after the pizza we ended up going to the bar, and then came home to the pillow fort we made before the pizza. Keep in mind I am still 20! I slipped the bouncer a $5 bill and told him “&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m with Gabe. Patron on ice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;” and he looked at my under age ID and nodded his head. 😂 It was for sure a night to remember 😂❤️.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Thomas Rhett Concert</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;We FINALLY got to go see Thomas Rhett and it was magical!! Although there were a couple mix-ups about what time the concert started and I waited till last minute to print the tickets (sorry again) we made it right on time and had a blast! There was a Thomas Rhett fathead that we used to take some really cute pictures, then we went in to find our seats. We were in the front row of the upper section which turned out to be perfect because we got to sit down and had a clear view of everything going on! The concert started with Walker Hayes, who was pretty good even though we only knew one of his songs (You Broke Up With Me). Next, Old Dominion came out and they were absolutely amazing😍 they played some songs we hadn’t heard before but everything they performed was awesome and we really enjoyed getting to see them. After their perfomance, I got on snapchat while in the bathroom line and found out that LAUREN AKINS was in the box TWO sections away from us. I can’t believe we didn’t know until she was gone, but we were so close to her and Thomas! I bought a very cute Thomas tshirt and then he came out on stage, and I was so excited I shook just about the entire time. He had so much energy and put on an awesome show, including some sweet shoutouts to Lauren and his kids. I cried twice (Marry Me &amp;amp; Die A Happy Man). This was my third time seeing Thomas but the other two didn’t even compare to this night, and I’m so glad I got to share this experience with you. I am obsessed with Thomas Rhett and this night meant so much to me, and so do you! To be honest, even though I’ve always loved him, you singing Die A Happy Man to me a few weeks after we met is what really got me loving him💗 everyone obsesses over finding a guy who loves them the way Thomas loves her, but I’ve already found mine. You’re the best 😘
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Florida Date Night</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;I was laying on the couch and you came over and asked if I wanted to make a deal: we would sell our Florida tickets, and we could use the money to go out for a fun date. Of course I agreed to this, so we posted on Facebook about an hour before the game started and ended up making $100 off the tickets. We left for Texas Roadhouse where we spent exactly $50 on a steak dinner. I purposefully sat on the side of the booth facing away from the TVs so you could watch the game, but you’re just as thoughtful and got your phone out so I could watch too😉 from there, we left for Malibu Jacks and played $40 worth of arcade games. We tried to figure out which games gave us the most tickets, and played everything from skee-ball to connect four to that game where you knock the pins over! We had a lot of fun, and I even one 150 tickets out of a claw machine in one turn! Then, we found out icees were $1 that night so we each got one and went home with $8, just enough to rent Now You See Me and Now You See Me 2 off Amazon for $4 each😂 we watched the end of the Florida game (very heartbreaking) then watched Now You see Me, even though I had too much fun with you and ended up falling asleep during the movie. Oh, we also got vouchers from Texas Roadhouse that we were supposed to bring back during the week of October 1st-October 7th to potentially win a Yeti Cooler, Amazon Echo, free steak for a week, etc…of course, we went back 10/6 and ended up both winning vouchers for free food and we don’t like any of the options given on the coupon lol. I still had a great night with you as always❤️
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>RWB Night 3</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;We missed Carly Pearce, probably because I took so long to get dressed and we were eavesdropping on a couple yelling at each other in the parking lot, but we got there in time to hear William Michael Morgan. He was pretty good considering we only knew one of his songs, I Met A Girl. Dustin came out and did a lot better than the last time we saw him. When he sang Where It’s At, he told the boys to get the pretty girls up on their shoulders and you sure did force me onto yours!! It was so fun though and my first time getting on someone’s shoulders! I’ve gotta say the view was much better from up there😉 during Dustin’s performance, I noticed a couple drunk girls that were lost from their bridal party (who were wearing matching flower crowns) and went to tell them where the rest of their crowd was. They started telling us how rude some woman had been to them earlier and repeatedly thanked me for helping them, then told me I was so sweet and told you “you need to marry this girl”…can’t say no to that 🤷 next Blake came out and was absolutely amazing, he sang so many of his new and old songs and did a great job. He pretended to leave and I turned around to tell you for the 30th time that I wanted to hear “Boys Round Here”. I told you that the concert couldn’t end that way, and that he was going to come out singing “red, red, red” and right when I said the second red, he came out behind me singing exactly that. I’m sure the excitement on my face was unreal. He came back out to sing that and God Gave Me You. I danced in your arms to My Eyes and God Gave Me You, and of course we danced to all the other songs too! It was the perfect ending to the perfect weekend. Thank you for being the best date to every event and making life so fun. I can’t wait till our next concert and making that “together list” a little longer 😘❤️
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>RWB Night 2</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;We had a late brunch at DV8 to start off the day! It’s our new favorite breakfast place, with really delicious food for cheap prices. This is the restaurant that hires people from the Hope Center, Chrysalis House, and other rehabs around town. Because my mom was in these rehabs, the opening of this restaurant was meaningful to me and I was excited to try it; even more so, I’m glad I got to share my first experience there with you and can’t wait to go back again. We got off to a very late start for the second night of Red, White, &amp;amp; Boom😂 after going rain boot shopping for me, stopping at DQ and Panera, AND stopping to fill your tires up, we finally made it to the concert at the tail end of Maren Morris’ performance. Then, Sam Hunt came out singing Leave The Night On and sang a couple of his own songs before starting to sing songs he had written for other artists (I Met A Girl, Cop Car, Come Over, etc). He could have been better live, but we still had a good time and were excited to end the weekend with Blake Shelton the next night. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>RWB Night 1</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Well the night started with, as usual, me struggling to find the right outfit (even though we were just going to stand outside in the rain for 6 hours). After finally deciding on something, I realized that I hadn’t printed out our tickets yet…then, I left them at home after printing them! Sorry about that 😉 we actually made it to the concert right on time and got to hear Kane Brown, Luke Combs, Brett Eldredge, and Luke Bryan. We danced all night in the mud and rain to Luke and Brett, a new favorite of ours! Not to mention we stood in the aftermath of a hurricane listening to Luke Combs sing “When It Rains It Pours” and “Hurricane” 💨 We were completely soaked and frozen by the time we made it home but I had the best time and wouldn’t have changed a thing😍 P.S. we ended the night cuddled up on the couch watching the Spongebob movie. We’re 5.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Kait's 21st Birthday Gallery</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Here you can write anything you want to remember the night. Be sure to write about how you felt and what you did so you remember everything in the future (maybe 20 years from now)! 
Tip: Since this is a “gallery” type page, you can place as many pictures as you want inside the folder for this gallery and it will show them all. Easy to organize right? 😘
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Kait's 21st Birthday</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday Kaitlyn! 
Welcome to your first website! 😘 
We can both post things here anything from videos of things we do, or pictures, or even just words. As time goes on we will both have posted a collection of stories and you will also hopefully learn a little more along the way about what I do! 😉 Hopefully it will all still be fun though ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>July 4th, 2017</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;This was our first time together watching fireworks, and it was everything we thought it would be! We met everyone at my grandma’s house and had food followed by fireworks. Remember when we were messing with Brennan and stole his fidget spinner and even the necklace off of his neck? 😂 We will have to remember that trick of making the phone go off to make him keep his hands to himself! 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Easter 🐣</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;We went to grandmas house and you were introduced to the wrath of an “egg battle”. You might remember that you won, but the truth is that I actually won 😘

				<title>Breaking into the Castle</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Our late night adventures are my favorite, but this one sticks out for some reason. With the Castle being purchased soon we will always have this story to share! 😏 That house behind the castle is still creepy..

				<title>Aquarium</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;We drove all the way to Newport just to go to the aquarium after a 6am shift of mine, and it was a blast! We didnt know at the time we would be back later, but we were driving around downtown for fun and even getting lost. Our adventures always tend to have a side adventure that makes everything so fun.

				<title>Hiking at Raven Run!</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;We weren’t supposed to go on this hiking trip because Mimi said someone had just fallen off a cliff somewhere else, but we went anyways because we’re rebels and I had the best possible view and a smile on my face as I hiked through the muddy trees and jumped across the rocks (so we didnt fall in the mud) with you ❤️
I wont tell if you wont! 🤐
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
