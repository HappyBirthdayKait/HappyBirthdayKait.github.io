Here is your list of things to do for the day in order of importance:<br>
- Let the dog out<br>
- Turn on the office <br>
- Turn on heating pad <br>
- Preheat oven for cookies? <br>
- Make a call to make it look like you're actually working <br>
- Take Kennedy out again <br>
- Get some lunch <br>
- Make another call <br>
- Play fetch with Kennedy, she's probably bored again <br>
- It's 5 o'clock, you're off the clock now!<br>

<br><b>4:30pm Reminder: </b>Make sure you give your boyfriend a kiss when he gets home, its what he will look forward to the most today! 
<br><br>I love you so much and I could never tell you enough how much it means to me that you chose to come up here with me and start a new chapter in our story. As always im sure whatever may come, this will be better than the last chapter ❤️.<br><br>
