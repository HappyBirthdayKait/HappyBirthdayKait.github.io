We missed Carly Pearce, probably because I took so long to get dressed and we were eavesdropping on a couple yelling at each other in the parking lot, but we got there in time to hear William Michael Morgan. He was pretty good considering we only knew one of his songs, I Met A Girl. Dustin came out and did a lot better than the last time we saw him. When he sang Where It's At, he told the boys to get the pretty girls up on their shoulders and you sure did force me onto yours!! It was so fun though and my first time getting on someone's shoulders! I've gotta say the view was much better from up thereüòâ during Dustin's performance, I noticed a couple drunk girls that were lost from their bridal party (who were wearing matching flower crowns) and went to tell them where the rest of their crowd was. They started telling us how rude some woman had been to them earlier and repeatedly thanked me for helping them, then told me I was so sweet and told you "you need to marry this girl"...can't say no to that ü§∑ next Blake came out and was absolutely amazing, he sang so many of his new and old songs and did a great job. He pretended to leave and I turned around to tell you for the 30th time that I wanted to hear "Boys Round Here". I told you that the concert couldn't end that way, and that he was going to come out singing "red, red, red" and right when I said the second red, he came out behind me singing exactly that. I'm sure the excitement on my face was unreal. He came back out to sing that and God Gave Me You. I danced in your arms to My Eyes and God Gave Me You, and of course we danced to all the other songs too! It was the perfect ending to the perfect weekend. Thank you for being the best date to every event and making life so fun. I can't wait till our next concert and making that "together list" a litle longer üòò‚ù§Ô∏è
