We went to see Luke Bryan at Riverbend today! He was performing with Cole Swindell and Jon Langston. We spent the night dancing around in the rain and singing and it was SO much fun. My favorite Luke concert I have been to, and I've been to 6 ;) 
Back in 2016, Luke Bryan at Riverbend was the first concert we ever went to together. It's cool looking back at pictures from that concert vs. tonight and just thinking how much we have grown together. We're so much more comfortable around each other and all the awkwardness of a new relationship has faded into something so fun and enjoyable. Thanks for being my date and making life so fun <3 

ALSO we got our couch today!! Slightly concerned about how it will fit in the new apartment lol but it's so beautiful, who cares!
