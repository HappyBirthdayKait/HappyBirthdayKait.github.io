We weren't supposed to go on this hiking trip because Mimi said someone had just fallen off a cliff somewhere else, but we went anyways because we're rebels and I had the best possible view and a smile on my face as I hiked through the muddy trees and jumped across the rocks (so we didnt fall in the mud) with you ‚ù§Ô∏è
I wont tell if you wont! ü§ê
