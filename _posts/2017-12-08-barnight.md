T'was the friday of dead week, so rather than being good students we came home to just chill out all night. While chilling you said "Lets build a fort" so I built the whole thing and had to drag you away from your dishes to help me, but it turned out reallllly nice! (Thats what you get for dating and engineer) I then tried to surprise you with a pizza but instead you got the email notification and then I realized I told it to go to your email 🙄. Later on that night after the pizza we ended up going to the bar, and then came home to the pillow fort we made before the pizza. Keep in mind I am still 20! I slipped the bouncer a $5 bill and told him "I'm with Gabe. Patron on ice" and he looked at my under age ID and nodded his head. 😂 It was for sure a night to remember 😂❤️.
