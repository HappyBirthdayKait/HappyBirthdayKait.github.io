We FINALLY got to go see Thomas Rhett and it was magical!! Although there were a couple mix-ups about what time the concert started and I waited till last minute to print the tickets (sorry again) we made it right on time and had a blast! There was a Thomas Rhett fathead that we used to take some really cute pictures, then we went in to find our seats. We were in the front row of the upper section which turned out to be perfect because we got to sit down and had a clear view of everything going on! The concert started with Walker Hayes, who was pretty good even though we only knew one of his songs (You Broke Up With Me). Next, Old Dominion came out and they were absolutely amazingüòç they played some songs we hadn't heard before but everything they performed was awesome and we really enjoyed getting to see them. After their perfomance, I got on snapchat while in the bathroom line and found out that LAUREN AKINS was in the box TWO sections away from us. I can't believe we didn't know until she was gone, but we were so close to her and Thomas! I bought a very cute Thomas tshirt and then he came out on stage, and I was so excited I shook just about the entire time. He had so much energy and put on an awesome show, including some sweet shoutouts to Lauren and his kids. I cried twice (Marry Me & Die A Happy Man). This was my third time seeing Thomas but the other two didn't even compare to this night, and I'm so glad I got to share this experience with you. I am obsessed with Thomas Rhett and this night meant so much to me, and so do you! To be honest, even though I've always loved him, you singing Die A Happy Man to me a few weeks after we met is what really got me loving himüíó everyone obsesses over finding a guy who loves them the way Thomas loves her, but I've already found mine. You're the best üòò
