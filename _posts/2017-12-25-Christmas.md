<h class="center"> <b>🎄MERRY CHRISTMAS!🌟</b> </h>
This year you got my full christmas experience. Everything I am used to including the 3 day event. Christmas eve at my grandfathers for his birthday, christmas at my moms, and then the day after christmas with my dad. 
My grandpa's birthday was fun, although hot! After all festivities, we continued out to all the christmas lights in the cold. We had to leave hartland because of the life size nutcrackers, but it was surely a memory to remember. It was a sight to see all around. 😍😉
This was our first christmas together. After some awkward conversation, you and I were arranged to stay together in my old room so that we could wake up in my room on christmas Eve. I think after this one, you understand the madness. I ran upstairs to jump on Brennan while you were drying your hair and jumped on Brennan "ITS CHRISTMAS ITS CHRISTMAS" just like he always got the pleasure of doing to me. It was just as fun as he said it was 😌. We spent all day opening presents and I got 2 pairs of slippers that were again too small just like the rest, a blanket from my mom that has shirts from my whole baseball career on it, and many other things. Your favorite seemed to be the largest, heaviest present under the tree which ended up small enough to be on your finger. You seem to really love it though, and after you open it (cant tell in the video) you whispered in my ear "I think I'm going to cry". I love to make you happy 😍 Theres no better feeling. Of course the day ends in catch phrase and we went home to unpack and order Chinese.
The next day was a calmer day by comparison, but still just as special. Met my dad at his house, opened presents, talked to Taryn while we ate pulled pork in the living room. My grandmother passed down the windup ice-skaters that I <strong>always</strong> played with at her house. We watched more Lifetime movies while I write this and you play angry birds and I couldn't be happier. 😇
