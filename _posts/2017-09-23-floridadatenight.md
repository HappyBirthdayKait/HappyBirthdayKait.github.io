I was laying on the couch and you came over and asked if I wanted to make a deal: we would sell our Florida tickets, and we could use the money to go out for a fun date. Of course I agreed to this, so we posted on Facebook about an hour before the game started and ended up making $100 off the tickets. We left for Texas Roadhouse where we spent exactly $50 on a steak dinner. I purposefully sat on the side of the booth facing away from the TVs so you could watch the game, but you're just as thoughtful and got your phone out so I could watch tooüòâ from there, we left for Malibu Jacks and played $40 worth of arcade games. We tried to figure out which games gave us the most tickets, and played everything from skee-ball to connect four to that game where you knock the pins over! We had a lot of fun, and I even one 150 tickets out of a claw machine in one turn! Then, we found out icees were $1 that night so we each got one and went home with $8, just enough to rent Now You See Me and Now You See Me 2 off Amazon for $4 eachüòÇ we watched the end of the Florida game (very heartbreaking) then watched Now You see Me, even though I had too much fun with you and ended up falling asleep during the movie. Oh, we also got vouchers from Texas Roadhouse that we were supposed to bring back during the week of October 1st-October 7th to potentially win a Yeti Cooler, Amazon Echo, free steak for a week, etc...of course, we went back 10/6 and ended up both winning vouchers for free food and we don't like any of the options given on the coupon lol. I still had a great night with you as always‚ù§Ô∏è
