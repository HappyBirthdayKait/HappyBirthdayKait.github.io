We got off to a very late start for the second night of Red, White, & BoomðŸ˜‚ after going rain boot shopping for me, stopping at DQ and Panera, AND stopping to fill your tires up, we finally made it to the concert at the tail end of Maren Morris' performance. Then, Sam Hunt came out singing Leave The Night On and sang a couple of his own songs before starting to sing songs he had written for other artists (I Met A Girl, Cop Car, Come Over, etc). He could have been better live, but we still had a good time and were excited to end the weekend with Blake Shelton the next night.
