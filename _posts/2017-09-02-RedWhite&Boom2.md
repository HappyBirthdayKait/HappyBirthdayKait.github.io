We had a late brunch at DV8 to start off the day! It's our new favorite breakfast place, with really delicious food for cheap prices. This is the restaurant that hires people from the Hope Center, Chrysalis House, and other rehabs around town. Because my mom was in these rehabs, the opening of this restaurant was meaningful to me and I was excited to try it; even more so, I'm glad I got to share my first experience there with you and can't wait to go back again. We got off to a very late start for the second night of Red, White, & BoomðŸ˜‚ after going rain boot shopping for me, stopping at DQ and Panera, AND stopping to fill your tires up, we finally made it to the concert at the tail end of Maren Morris' performance. Then, Sam Hunt came out singing Leave The Night On and sang a couple of his own songs before starting to sing songs he had written for other artists (I Met A Girl, Cop Car, Come Over, etc). He could have been better live, but we still had a good time and were excited to end the weekend with Blake Shelton the next night.
