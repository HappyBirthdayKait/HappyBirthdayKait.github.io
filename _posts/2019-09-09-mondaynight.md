I want to start using this to document times that make me happy. I feel like I have mostly used it for big events, but the little day-to-day moments are what make up our relationship and I want to remember those too. The times where we don’t take pictures, but we have fun together doing the most simple things and just realize how much we enjoy each other’s company. Tonight is one of those nights. I came home from work to you playing your game. Per usual, I am sick and have a sinus infection. I got my groceries put away and cleaned up some other things, then got in the shower. You got off the computer while I was doing that and got up to empty the dishwasher and get kitchen cleaned up, then came to see if I wanted stir fry for dinner. We went to the store and just listened to music and talked on our drive there and back. Now, I’m laying on the couch watching Friends bloopers and cuddling with Kennedy while you cook. When you’re done, we’ll eat and watch Penn & Teller and cuddle <3 there’s nothing inherently special about tonight, but it’s little things like tonight that make me realize how lucky I am. Lucky to have such a sweet boyfriend, and that I get to spend my life with you and our sweet dog. Some days are hard - this week I’m sick and just struggling to get through work, but at the end of every day, I know I have you and Kennedy and that makes me feel whole. Wherever you two are, I’m safe and at home. Thank you for the stability and comfort you bring me just by being you.
