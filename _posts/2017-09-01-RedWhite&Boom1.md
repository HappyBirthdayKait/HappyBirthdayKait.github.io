Well the night started with, as usual, me struggling to find the right outfit (even though we were just going to stand outside in the rain for 6 hours). After finally deciding on something, I realized that I hadn't printed out our tickets yet...then, I left them at home after printing them! Sorry about that 😉 we actually made it to the concert right on time and got to hear Kane Brown, Luke Combs, Brett Eldredge, and Luke Bryan. We danced all night in the mud and rain to Luke and Brett, a new favorite of ours! Not to mention we stood in the aftermath of a hurricane listening to Luke Combs sing "When It Rains It Pours" and "Hurricane" 💨 We were completely soaked and frozen by the time we made it home but I had the best time and wouldn't have changed a thing😍
